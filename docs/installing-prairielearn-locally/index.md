# Installing PrairieLearn Locally

To write coding questions, you are required to install PrairieLearn locally. To write non-coding questions, it is not required, but recommended for easier and safer testing and debugging. All instructions for writing questions assume you have installed PrairieLearn locally.

The official PrairieLearn documentation has instructions [here](https://prairielearn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing/), but I have written simplified instructions for each operating system.

Select your operating system for instructions:

- [Windows]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/installing-prairielearn-locally/windows.md %})
- [macOS]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/installing-prairielearn-locally/macos.md %})
