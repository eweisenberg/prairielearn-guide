# Markdown

Markdown is a simple formatting syntax that can be converted to HTML. PrairieLearn supports the `<markdown>` tag in `question.html` files, in which Markdown syntax can be used. Here is an example of how Markdown syntax can be used and what it looks like in a PrairieLearn question:

```html
<markdown>This is a paragraph.

To add another paragraph, separate it by a blank line.

Enclose some text in single asterisks to make *italicized text*. Use double asterisks for **bolded text** and triple asterisks for ***bolded and italicized text***.

To add inline code text like `this`, enclose the text in backticks (above the tab key on your keyboard).</markdown>
```
