# Non-Coding Questions

While you are able to write non-coding questions using the online PrairieLearn editor, it is recommended to locally install PrairieLearn for easier testing and debugging.

To learn how to implement different types of non-coding questions, see [Types of Questions](types-of-questions.html).

To learn how to add randomly generated questions for any question type, see [Randomized Questions](randomized-questions.html).

To learn how to add format your question, see [question.html Formatting](../question-html-formatting/index.html).

After you are finished writing a question, remember to add the topic and tags that accurately reflect the current question.
