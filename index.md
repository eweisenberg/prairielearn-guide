# Guide to writing PrairieLearn questions for CS 2100 at UVA

If you are new to writing PrairieLearn questions, you should skim through the following PrairieLearn documentation pages:

- [Course configuration](https://prairielearn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/course/)
- [Course instance configuration](https://prairielearn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/courseInstance/) (just the "Directory layout" section)
- [Assessments](https://prairielearn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/assessment/) (not required for writing questions, but helpful to understand how students will see the questions and how assessments will be created)
- [Questions](https://prairielearn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/question/)

To begin writing questions, you should [install PrairieLearn locally]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/installing-prairielearn-locally/index.md %}). While it is not required to install locally to develop non-coding questions, it makes testing questions quicker and safer. Installing locally is required for coding questions. Instructions for writing all types of questions will be assuming you are running PrairieLearn locally.
